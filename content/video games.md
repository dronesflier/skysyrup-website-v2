## memorable videogames

### ![[undertale.png]]
tbh undertale is probably my favorite game of all time—it really is the definitive videogame. if you play a single game I list here, it should be undertale. it's a kinda rpg-styled game with touhou-like combat mechanics, and it's extremely story-focused. your choices are everything.

ULTRAKILL is a really fast fps-like shooter, almost more of a movement game than an actual shooter. the only limit on how fast you can do things is the speed at which you can move your fingers. it's one of my favorite games because of the raw replayability introduced by the amazingly tuned movement system (i have >~~150~~ 400 hours in this game which has like 6 hours of actual content) and I just looooooove it.

no man's sky is an infinite space exploration game. go anywhere, be anyone, do anything. you could set up a colony, build a factory, mine for ores, explore the trillions of planets and galaxies, become a pirate, PVP with others online, coop multiplayer, invade sentinel (=police force) camps... it's like minecraft but in space. this is a surprisingly relaxing game for just... existing. i just stare at how pretty it is nowadays lol
funnily enough its also a REALLY good vr game :33
