## ABOUT ME

 i am ashley! I do lots of things, i do silly things, i do less silly things.

i work at a local small company that does websites for a couple of (semi-)local businesses. technically, I know PHP. but heyy! that's just a theory. :D In all seriousness, I do spend a lot of time on the internet, and I hope I can share some of it, along with my general thoughts, with you!

i have a multitude of hobbies, and I try to keep up with them ..mostly. I spend a lot of time with computers, obviously, both in a software and somewhat hardware sense. furthermore, I spend lots of time playing [[video games]], specifically RPGs like Undertale, DELTARUNE, and so on. Vocaloid is also a big part of my musical sense. I also play the piano, and try to compose music every so often.

also, I consume too much political content! specifically, I try to involve myself in local [[politics]], because it really helps my ability to stay focused and not get lost in online circlejerks. to that extent, I'm part of BÜNDNIS 90/ Die Grünen, which has let me meet some really amazing people and actually do something. I really recommend you to get involved in [[local politics]], even if it's just a small group of people. it really helps you stay grounded and not get ...lost in the online world.

I HAVE CATS!! THREE OF THEM, actually! cats are the bestest thing in this world and they deserve it as well.
